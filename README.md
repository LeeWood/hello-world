My name is Aleesha W. I was born in Philadelphia, but raised in the Midwestern state of Ohio. I went to art school for illustration and graphic design after I graduated high school. I'm a freelance illustrator who is currently going back to school for full stack web development. I love bugsa and I hate crowds.
